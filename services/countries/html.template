      <h1>The Global Hunger Index (Demo for IOGDC2012)</h1>
      <p>The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool adapted and further developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to compre- hensively measure and track global hunger.1 The GHI incorporates three interlinked hunger-related indicators â€“ the proportion of under- nourished in the population, the prevalence of underweight in children, and the mortality rate of children.</p>
